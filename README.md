# DogTeethCleaningToy
In this project we wish to develop a multifunction electronic dog toy. It can clean your dogs' teeth through moderate, self-adaptive vibration when your dog is biting the toy. A treat dispenser subsystem is included to help your dogs develop a good habits of brushing their teeth regularly.

Hardware of this project is designed and developed by Yilong Zhang (yilongz3@illinois.edu) and Angela Jiang (angelaj4@illinois.edu), all credits to them.
